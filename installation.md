## Installation Guideline

1. Download the latest version of the application from [here](https://github.com/darkmatter18/WhatsThere/releases/latest/download/WhatsThere.apk)

2. Make sure you have turned on **Allow Installation from Unknown Sources**. If you didn't do that, Android will prompt you to do so.

3. Install the App, by **Clicking the Install Button**.

4. If you get a prompt like this, make sure you click **INSTALL ANYWAY**, otherwise the app will not install.

<br>
![Play Protect Warning]
<br>
Google Play Store does not recognize me as an authorized developer. This is the reason of the pop-up alert.
</p>

5. If you get another prompt like this, make sure you click **SEND**

<br>
![Play Protect Send]
<br>
A copy of the App will be send to Google. It would help in reconsidering the stance of Play Protect.
</p>
	
6. Now the app should be installed and work properly.
